# RAG MVP Status

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system has reached Minimum Viable Product (MVP) status! This document summarizes what has been implemented and what's planned for future iterations.

## MVP Features Implemented

âœ… **Document Processing**:
- Markdown document loading from vault
- YAML frontmatter extraction
- Text chunking with configurable parameters
- File system watching for real-time updates

âœ… **Embedding Generation**:
- Integration with Ollama for embeddings
- Document and query embedding generation
- Error handling and logging

âœ… **Vector Storage**:
- ChromaDB integration for vector storage
- Document storage and retrieval
- Similarity search with configurable k parameter

âœ… **RAG Service**:
- Integration of all components
- Context augmentation for LLM prompts
- Proper prompt engineering for effective responses
- Fallback handling for no-context scenarios

âœ… **Command-Line Interface**:
- Document indexing
- Query processing
- Configuration management
- System statistics

âœ… **API Server**:
- REST API for integration
- Query endpoint
- Statistics endpoint
- Real-time document watching

## What's Working Now

With the current implementation, you can:

1. **Index your documentation**:
   ```bash
   obelisk-rag index
   ```

2. **Query your documentation**:
   ```bash
   obelisk-rag query "What is Obelisk?"
   ```

3. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   obelisk-rag serve --watch
   ```

4. **Configure the system**:
   ```bash
   obelisk-rag config --set "retrieve_top_k=5"
   ```

5. **View system statistics**:
   ```bash
   obelisk-rag stats
   ```

## Areas for Future Enhancement

While the MVP is functional and production-ready, several areas could be enhanced in future iterations:

ðŸ”„ **Advanced Chunking**:
- Semantic chunking based on content meaning
- Heading-based chunking
- Improved handling of code blocks and tables

ðŸ”„ **Enhanced Retrieval**:
- Hybrid retrieval (keywords + vectors)
- Re-ranking of retrieved documents
- Filtering based on metadata

ðŸ”„ **Advanced LLM Integration**:
- Support for more models
- Streaming responses
- Model parameter customization

ðŸ”„ **Web UI Integration**:
- Dedicated Web UI components
- Visualization of retrieved contexts
- Search highlighting

ðŸ”„ **Performance Optimization**:
- Caching for frequent queries
- Batch processing for large document sets
- Benchmarking and optimization

## Next Steps

The next development priorities are:

1. **Web UI Integration**: Create tight integration with Open WebUI
2. **Enhanced Evaluation**: Implement evaluation tools for measuring RAG quality
3. **Advanced Retrieval**: Add re-ranking and hybrid retrieval capabilities
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Add mechanisms to incorporate user feedback

## Conclusion

The RAG MVP provides a solid foundation for document retrieval and generation in Obelisk. It enables users to interact with their documentation through natural language queries and receive contextually relevant responses.

As we move forward, we'll continue to enhance and expand the RAG capabilities based on user feedback and emerging best practices in the field of retrieval augmented generation.
