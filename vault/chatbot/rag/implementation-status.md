The implementation provides a solid foundation for document retrieval and generation in Obelisk. It enables users to interact with their documentation through natural language queries and receive contextually relevant responses using their own local infrastructure.

We've overcome several technical challenges related to metadata handling, error resilience, and system integration. The result is a robust system that can be easily deployed and used in production environments.

As we move forward, we'll continue to enhance and expand the RAG capabilities based on user feedback and emerging best practices in the field of retrieval augmented generation.
